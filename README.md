# Poisson-Distributions
Poisson distribution code - applying to hypothetical examples

Poisson distributions predict the probabilty of events occuring in the future given the number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time.

## Example problems:
Example 2. The number of people in line in front of you at the grocery store. Predictors may include the number of items currently offered at a special discounted price and whether a special event (e.g., a holiday, a big sporting event) is three or fewer days away.
